## Hello world 👋

I'm Ishpreet, a 4th-year student pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at McMaster University. I am most proficient in the programming languages of Python, Java, and C, and some of my current programming interests include machine learning, front-end development, and game development. If not programming, you can probably find me enjoying a nice movie, learning about the latest developments in computers, reading, or making myself the perfect latte. 

### TL:DR - 

- 🖥️ I am most proficient in Python, Java, and C programming languages.
