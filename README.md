## Hello world 👋

I'm Ishpreet, a 4th-year student currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at McMaster University. I am infatuated with all things tech, but I have a special passion for the art of computer programming, with some of my current interests including machine learning, front-end development, and game development.

### A bit about me:

- 🖥️ I am most proficient in the programming languages of Python, Java, and C.
- 🔭 I am always on the hunt to take on new opportunities and learn new skills.
- 🌱 I am currently learning web development, how to develop and optimize machine learning models, and how to make the perfect latte.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me through my [email](mailto:ishpreetnagi@gmail.com)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I took professional dance for nearly 4 years.
